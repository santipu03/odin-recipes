    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup warm milk (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>your mother</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, dissolve yeast and white sugar in warm milk. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir the egg yolks and melted butter into the milk mixture. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, salt, nutmeg and lemon zest. Beat the flour mixture into the milk/egg mixture 1 cup at a time. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and supple, about 8 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 2 hours.</li>
    </ol>
